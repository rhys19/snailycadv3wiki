## How to change map tiles

Q: How can I change the map files for the live map in SnailyCAD?

A:

1. First you'll need to extract your map files(.ytd) from OpenIV. Make sure they have the correct naming:

   - `minimap_sea_0_0.png`
   - `minimap_sea_0_1.png`
   - `minimap_sea_1_0.png`
   - `minimap_sea_1_1.png`
   - `minimap_sea_2_0.png`
   - `minimap_sea_2_1.png`

2. Navigate to the following folder: `public/tiles/`.
3. Replace the corresponding files with your custom tiles.
4. All done! Restart the CAD and you should see your custom map.
